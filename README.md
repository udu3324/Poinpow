# üìò Features
Poinpow is a fabric mod that adds **amazing features** and **makes the player experience 103% better**. (QoL) Features that Minehut locks behind a paywall (ex: removing ads, muting chat, etc.) are in Poinpow.

Example of **BlockLobbyAds** (blocks ads made by player) and **BlockLobbyMapAds**. It clears up chat a lot and blocks those awful map ads.
